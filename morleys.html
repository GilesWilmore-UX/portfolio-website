        <h2>OVERVIEW</h2>
        <hr>

        <p class="left">Morleys is a fried chicken chain which has intertwined itself in the culture of South London.  This project focuses on a redesign of their website using UX and UI best practices.
        </p>

        <h2>CONTEXT & CHALLENGE</h2>
        <hr>
        <p class="left"> Morley’s Fried Chicken chain came to me and asked me to redesign their website so that visitors could navigate their way around the site with a bit more fluidity.  They wanted  a platform where their customers could easily find information about store branches and the food offered in their stores.
The purpose of the redesign was so that Morleys could compete with other fast food chains out there who are quickly refining and promoting their online presence.
<br>
How do you make a fried chicken shop look cool?
<br>
Morleys current website was functional but doesn’t truly represent the image they would like to portray.  It also conflicts with a lot of UX best practices, which I will go through in a later section.
        </p>

        <h2>MY ROLE</h2>
        <hr>
        <p class="left"> This project required me deliver on the UX and UI design of the website.
        </P>
      </div>
    </div>
    <div class="row mt centered">
      <div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2">
        <h2>PROCESS & INSIGHT</h2>
        <hr>
        <p class="left"> After multiple meetings with stakeholders I began to get a better picture of what they wanted from this redesign and what they hoped it would achieve.
          <br>
          <br>
They wanted their website first and foremost to be simple and easy to use so that visitors could easily find information they needed regarding food and site locations, as well as a point of contact for potential franchisees and media contacts.
They also wanted their website to look cool and represent their presence as an iconic establishment in South London.
<br>
<br>
But as a UX designer I thought it best to test the current site with potential visitors and get real grasps of any issues from them.
        <br>
        <br>
        I found 3 main issues when observing users on the current site
        <br>
        <br>
1. The food menu wasn’t extensive and didn’t show all of the food that is on offer in store
<br>
<br>
2. There was no clear way to find and locate nearests stores.  What they had under “restaurants” was a long list of restaurants and a user would have to scroll through them to find one that might be near to them (or a specific location).
<br>
<br>
3. The visual design of the site in general was cluttered and hard to make sense of sometimes.</p>

        <h3>Competetive Analysis</h3>
        <hr>
        <p class="left"> Researching similar fast food sites such as Burger king, KFC, favorite chicken, proved that there patterns in the way the food is displayed and also in the way that you can find a store through the website.

        <h3>Ideation</h3>
        <hr>
        <p class="left"> Morleys wanted to be a website that was simple and easy to use.  With this mantra in mind, I began to think of Occam's Razor by asking myself:
        </P>
        <br>
        <h4 class="centered loud">“What is the minimum amount of UI that will allow the content to be found and effectively communicate to the user?”</h4>
        <br>
      <p class="left">I began by looking at each design element in the current site and evaluating it's effectiveness. If it didnt have meaning or provide value, I removed it.</p>
      <br>
      <br>
      <h4 class="centered loud">“Perfection is achieved not when there is nothing more to add, but when there is nothing left to take away”. — Antoine de Saint-Exupéry</h4>
      <br>
      <p class="left">
        Due to tight timescales to produce deliverables, I decided to get sketch some ideas and flows out on paper.  I have taken a mobile first approach to this design to make sure only necessary and important info is included and because a high proportion of users will be viewing the site through a smart phone.
<br>
<br>
I imported these sketches into marvel app and tested the flows with users.
<br>
I wanted to see if they could find specific food items and also if the flow of finding a store was natural to them.
