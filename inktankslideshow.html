        <h2>OVERVIEW</h2>
        <hr>

        <p class="left">InkTank is for anyone who is looking for tattoo inspiration whether they be new to the tattoo world or inked up to their eyeballs. Tattoo artists can also use the platform to show off their work, offering a mutually
          beneficial interaction for both sets of users.
          In this project, I explore tattoo enthusiasts thought processes and reasoning during their tattoo journey. Combining this with UX principles, I design an innovative web app that is easy to use and connects users to the tattoo world.
        </p>

        <h2>CONTEXT & CHALLENGE</h2>
        <hr>
        <p class="left"> Getting a tattoo is an incredibly personal experience. Tattoos can be a visual representation of their hosts personalities and experiences, from whimsical adventure to deep emotional connections. Getting “inked” is a big
          decision and a massive industry. There’s a lot of emotion wrapped up in the decision to get a tattoo. Through design with a solid user experience, we can genuinely help people find what they’re looking for in an effort to reduce regret and
          empower people to express themselves in a meaningful way.
          <br>
          <br>
          The challenge here is to design a web app where users can explore tattoo inspiration whether they are on the go or chilling at home. This platform has to have the tools to help users make well-informed decisions on the tattoo’s they decide
          to get, whilst also connecting them to a world of tattoo artists. Through testing with potential users and constant iterations, we will know if InkTank delivers on these goals.

        <h2>PROCESS & INSIGHT</h2>
        <hr>
        <p class="left"> I embarked on this project by understanding the problem that needed to be solved.</p>
        <h4 class="centered loud">“Find the problem first, not the solution”.</h4>
        <br>
        <br>
        <p class="left">I did this through Competitive Research and user interviews.
          The User interviews were helpful in unravelling what users’ true desires and needs were when exploring tattoo inspiration or making that decision on what tattoo to get. Through speaking with real potential users i discovered what hurdles
          they face online and also in real Tattoo parlours.
          The Competitive research helped me to get a better understanding of what was currently out there app wise in the tattoo world and also to spot any opportunities to create something better.

          I made sure i spoke to a range of potential users, from those who already had multiple tattoos, to those just dipping their toe in this curious and addictive world.

        <h3>Who are InkTank’s users and what do they want?</h3>
        <hr>
        <p class="left"> The interviews brought up some interesting insights and analysis of the interviews narrowed them down into three main themes.
        </p>
        <h4 class="interest">1. InkTank users value the opinion of tattoo artists and appreciated their input and design ideas - This helps them feel more confident in both their decision to get a tattoo and on the final design</h4>
        <br>
        <h4 class="interest">2. They explore ideas by looking at images online - Something they can easily do whilst watching tv or during the commute to work.
        </h4>
        <br>
        <h4 class="interest">3. Some users are only interested in certain styles of tattoos - they need a way to selectively view only styles they like.
        </h4>

            <br>
            First of all the users weren’t sure if they had selected a board or not (no visual clues).
            <br>
            Secondly they weren't sure were to tap in order to save the image to the inspiration board (click the X in the top left)

            <br>
            2. Tick appears when user taps on inspiration board which let’s them know the board has been selected
            <br>
            3. Obvious “Save” button becomes active when board selected so User knows how to save.

          <p class="left">The filter page was another page that left users randomly pressing areas of the screen to progress.
            One reason was because the “apply filters” button was not visible as users needed to scroll down to find it.
            There were also some UI factors that needed to be polished to make the filter page experience better.

            <br>
            1. Apply Filters Button has been fixed to the bottom so that it is always visible as users scroll through filter options.
            <br>
            2. When real images used as thumbnails for tattoo styles, the text became hard to read. To give contrast between bacgkround and text, I added a background colour and decreased opacity of the forground image whilst centering the text.
